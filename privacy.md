## Privacy Policy for OSTConf

OSTConf does not collect any personal data and shares it with me. The only connection is 
* when accessing `www.heinrichsweikamp.net` to download the firmware,
* when backing up/restoring the configurations of your OSTC dive computer in your iCloud drive,
* when sending the log file by email to me for debugging purposes. In this case no personal data will be transmitted except the serial number of your dive computer.
