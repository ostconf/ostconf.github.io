OSTConf is an application for configuring your OSTC dive computer. It allows you to read 
and modify settings and parameters of dive computers manufactured by 
[heinrichs weikamp GmbH](http://www.heinrichsweikamp.com).

Using Bluetooth LE technology, you can retrieve device information, update date and time, 
custom text, set up your gas mixes and deco parameters as well as upgrading the firmware.

## Firmware Update

* * *

### OSTC 2, 3, plus etc.

In previous versions of the app some users had problems with updating the firmware. This problem is solved now by skipping 
the "Verify" step which is actually not necessary: the OSTC will neither install a corrupt firmware file. However, you 
still can enable "Verify" in the settings.

### OSTC 4

The OSTC4 firmware consists of three different parts (firmware, RTE, fonts). In each update step only one part is updated. Thus, you have to execute the update up to three times - a dialog shows the details.

## Backup and Restore

* * *

You can use OSTConf for saving all parameter settings of your OSTC device to your iCloud drive. Sharing these backup files across multiple devices requires that you have enabled iCloud support on your Apple device(s). Later you can restore all settings from a backup files. 
On the Backup/Restore page of OSTConf you can also delete (left swipe) these files or even rename it (long tap). However, this is also possible using the "Files" app or on any other Apple device connected to your iCloud drive.

## App Settings

* * *

If you don't like the standard mode of the app then just use the dark mode of your iOS device.
 
## Requirements

* * *

*  iOS device such as iPhone or iPad running iOS 13
*  Bluetooth capable OSTC (no USB, sorry)

## Known issues

* * *

1. ~~Firmware upload fails on some OSTC devices - will be (hopefully) fixed in version 1.1.2.~~
2. ~~OSTC4 not fully supported yet (firmware update, OSTC4-specific settings).~~
3.  ~~Not all OSTC settings are supported yet, but this will change.~~
5.  ~~Sometimes the app is not able to connect to the device even if the device was discovered. Often, it helps to press the Scan button again.~~
5.  ~~After a firmware update and reboot of the OSTC no connection can be established. Workaround: just restart the app.~~
