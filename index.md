3.  ~~Not all OSTC settings are supported yet, but this will change.~~
5.  ~~Sometimes the app is not able to connect to the device even if the device was discovered. Often, it helps to press the Scan button again.~~
5.  ~~After a firmware update and reboot of the OSTC no connection can be established. Workaround: just restart the app.~~
